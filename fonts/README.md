# RyzeUI Font Icons

RyzeUI Font Icons are created using the [IcoMoon App](https://icomoon.io).

You may import this file both via the Import Icons button in the app, or via the project manager (accessed from Main Menu > Manage Projects). If you import your `selection.json` file via the project manager, your project settings will get imported too.
